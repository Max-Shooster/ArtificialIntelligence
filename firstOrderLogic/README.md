Description: Implement a theorem prover for a subset of first order logic (FOL).
Given a single file encoding a knowledge base (KB) in conjunctive normal form
(CNF), the program should determine if the KB is satisfiable and print either,
"yes" (it is satisfiable; it cannot find any new clauses) or "no" (it is not
satisfiable; it finds the empty clause). 

Input: The program should take 1 argument, KB.cnf. 
e.g. python firstOrderLogic.py KB.cnf
